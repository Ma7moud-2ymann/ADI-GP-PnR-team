# 🧩 PULPissimo ASIC Flow — From Synthesis to Final GDSII   <!-- H1 (largest) -->

This repository documents the complete ASIC design flow of the PULPissimo SoC, covering all stages from RTL synthesis to finishing. It contains organized scripts, logs, and configuration files for each phase of the flow, using industry-standard Synopsys tools.

This project aims to demonstrate the full ASIC implementation flow for the open-source PULPissimo SoC platform. The process follows a standard RTL-to-GDSII design methodology using Synopsys EDA tools, ensuring optimized PPA (Power, Performance, and Area) and functional correctness through all stages.
