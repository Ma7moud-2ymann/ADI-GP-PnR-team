# 🧩 PULPissimo ASIC Flow — From Synthesis to Final GDSII   <!-- H1 (largest) -->

This repository contains the complete implementation flow for the PULPissimo microcontroller, from RTL synthesis to final GDSII layout. 

##  Overview                                              <!-- H2 -->
PULPissimo is a popular, open-source microcontroller platform from the PULP (Parallel Ultra Low Power) project. This project takes the RTL description of PULPissimo and implements it through the entire RTL-to-GDSII flow, culminating in a tapeout-ready layout.

The repository is structured to provide a step-by-step guide, with scripts and configuration files for each stage of the ASIC design process.
